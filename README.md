Please imagine we have some companies that are the owner of some electronic charging stations. One company can own other charging companies as well, which means a parent company, can access all the child company's stations hierarchically. now a driver wants to find the nearest electronic station and recharge his/her car, but each company has its own charging technology, for example, one has stations with high volume voltage another with fast-charge capability, and so on. so, it would be Important for drivers to base on her/his criteria, select the nearest stations of a specific company.
